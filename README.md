I'm an aspiring programmer from Colorado.

I started my programming journey in 2020 and use many platforms learning Python, JavaScript, SQL, NoSQL, Docker, and APIs. I'm interested in learning more and becoming a full stack developer.

My main background is Telecommunications. I current handle software support but I have 20+ years experience in RF Design and AutoCAD mapping.
